## Abstract

Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations are a powerful approach for solving polynomial op-
timization problems (POPs), yet their scalability remains a challenge. This paper surveys advance-
ments in first-order methods for SDP relaxations, focusing on inexact projected gradient methods
(iPGM) as proposed by Yang et al. (2021). Their method integrates projected gradient updates with
rounding and nonlinear lifting strategies to efficiently solve rank-one SDP relaxations, enabling
faster convergence and improved scalability. We contextualize this approach by reviewing related
methodologies, including regularization techniques by Nie and Wang (2012) and Alternating Di-
rection Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based sum-of-squares methods by Zheng et al. (2019). To
validate iPGMâ€™s effectiveness, we reproduce numerical results from Yang et al. (2021) using the
STRIDE algorithm and detail key proofs of the STRIDE algorithm. This study provides empiri-
cal insights into computational efficiency, convergence behavior, and solution accuracy, offering a
comparative assessment of first-order methods for SDP relaxations in polynomial optimization.
